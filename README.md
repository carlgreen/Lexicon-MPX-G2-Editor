[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carlgreen/Lexicon-MPX-G2-Editor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carlgreen/Lexicon-MPX-G2-Editor)

An editor for the Lexicon MPX G2 effects unit.

# Roadmap

1. Parse a sysex file dumped from an MPX G2 and print this out nicely.

2. Create a sysex file from the in-memory representation that can be imported into an MPX G2.

3. Build some kind of interface over this to make it easy.

I'm currently in phase 1.
